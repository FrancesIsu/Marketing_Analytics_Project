# Marketing Analysis


## Project Background
ShopEasy is a global online retailer specializing in sports gear and fitness equipment. Its marketing focuses on customer engagement through social media, videos, and blogs. Despite recent marketing efforts, the company faces declining engagement and conversion rates.

Key areas analyzed include:

- **Conversion Rate:** Percentage of website visitors who make a purchase.

- **Customer Engagement:** Interaction level with content (clicks, likes, comments).

- **Customer Feedback:** Average ratings from customer reviews.

ShopEasyâ€™s data structure consists of five tables: customer reviews, customer journey, engagement data, customers, products, and geography.
